# Security Policy

## Overview

This OpenWrt build system is designed with security as a first-class concern. This document outlines our security practices, reporting procedures, and implementation details.

## Security Features

### Build Security

- **Reproducible Builds**: All builds are deterministic and can be verified
- **Secure Build Environment**: Containerized builds with minimal dependencies
- **Dependency Verification**: Package integrity checks and signature verification
- **Automated Scanning**: Continuous security scanning of dependencies and configurations

### Runtime Security

- **Hardened Kernel**: Enhanced security features including ASLR, stack protection
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only essential services enabled by default
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration with defense in depth
- **Regular Updates**: Automated tracking and building of security updates

### Network Security

- **Firewall**: nftables-based firewall with strict default rules
- **VPN Ready**: Built-in WireGuard and OpenVPN support
- **DNS Security**: DNS-over-HTTPS and ad-blocking capabilities
- **Network Segmentation**: VLAN support for traffic isolation

## Supported Versions

We maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Latest Release | ✅ | Full security support |
| Previous Release | ✅ | Security patches only |
| Older Releases | ❌ | No longer supported |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in this build system or the resulting firmware:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** send an email to the project maintainer with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with fix timeline
- **30 days**: Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter)

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation
- **High**: Local privilege escalation, significant data exposure
- **Medium**: DoS attacks, limited information disclosure
- **Low**: Minor security issues with limited impact

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Change Default Passwords**: Always change default passwords immediately
2. **Enable SSH Keys**: Disable password authentication, use SSH keys
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep firmware updated with latest security patches
4. **Network Segmentation**: Use VLANs to separate network traffic
5. **Monitor Access**: Review access logs regularly
6. **Strong Encryption**: Use WPA3 for wireless networks

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require peer review
2. **Security Testing**: Include security tests in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
4. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
5. **Documentation**: Document security implications of changes

## Security Configuration

### Kernel Hardening

```bash
# Enable kernel security features
CONFIG_SECURITY=y
CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y
CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG=y
CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX=y
CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM=y
```

### Network Security

```bash
# Firewall configuration
uci set firewall.@defaults[0].drop_invalid='1'
uci set firewall.@defaults[0].syn_flood='1'
uci set firewall.@defaults[0].tcp_syncookies='1'
```

### SSH Hardening

```bash
# SSH security settings
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].PasswordAuth='0'
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].RootPasswordAuth='0'
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].Port='22'
```

## Threat Model

### Assets Protected

- **Router Configuration**: Device settings and credentials
- **Network Traffic**: Data passing through the router
- **Connected Devices**: Devices on the local network
- **VPN Connections**: Remote access credentials and traffic

### Threat Actors

- **External Attackers**: Internet-based threats
- **Local Network Attackers**: Threats from compromised local devices
- **Physical Attackers**: Direct physical access to device
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or firmware

### Attack Vectors

- **Network-based Attacks**: Remote exploitation via network services
- **Web Interface Attacks**: Exploitation of management interface
- **Firmware Attacks**: Malicious firmware updates
- **Physical Attacks**: UART/JTAG access, firmware extraction

## Incident Response

### Detection

- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of build system
- **User Reports**: Community-driven vulnerability reporting
- **Security Scanning**: Regular automated security assessments
- **Threat Intelligence**: Monitoring of security advisories

### Response Steps

1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Mitigation**: Implement temporary fixes
4. **Communication**: Notify users of security issues
5. **Resolution**: Deploy permanent fixes
6. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
7. **Lessons Learned**: Improve processes and procedures

## Security Tools

### Build-time Security

- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for known vulnerable packages
- **Configuration Validation**: Verify security settings
- **Reproducible Builds**: Ensure build integrity

### Runtime Security

- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitor for suspicious activity
- **Log Analysis**: Automated log monitoring
- **Network Monitoring**: Traffic analysis and anomaly detection
- **Update Management**: Automated security updates

## Compliance

### Standards

This project aims to comply with:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **OWASP Security Guidelines**
- **CIS Security Benchmarks**
- **ISO 27001 Security Controls**

### Certifications

While not formally certified, our security practices are designed to meet:

- **Common Criteria**: Security evaluation standards
- **FIPS 140-2**: Cryptographic module requirements
- **FCC Part 15**: Radio frequency regulations

## Security Contacts

- **Project Maintainer**: Create an issue for general security questions
- **Security Team**: For vulnerability reports (see reporting section above)
- **Community**: OpenWrt security mailing list for broader security discussions
